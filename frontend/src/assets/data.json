This involved redirecting traffic from the servers, which allowed the attackers to issue valid TLS certificates and thereby capture the contents of the Jabber server. What is particularly sensitive is the fact that the servers are hosted in Germany. This gave us the impetus to introduce a new security measure that will make such attacks on systemli.org services and websites much more difficult.Read more30/04 2023Is Linux hard disk encryption hacked?Ivan, an anarchist who has been in pre-trial detention in France for some time, reported in a letter that French police were able to gain access to the contents of his laptop.Read more06/02 2023Shutdown of jabber.systemli.org on 08/31/2023For a long time, Jabber/XMPP was an important platform for many for encrypted communication without monitoring.
